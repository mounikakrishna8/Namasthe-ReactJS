### In a typical full-stack web application using this technology stack:

#### Front-End: 
    The user interface is built with React.js, styled with CSS, and structured with HTML.

#### Back-End: 
    The server-side logic is handled by Node.js with Express.js, and database operations are managed using Sequelize as an interface to PostgreSQL.
#### Development Experience: 
    Vite enhances the development experience with efficient tooling. This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# This App uses the following stack of Technologies.

## 1.Front-End (Client-Side):

### HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language):
     Used to structure the content on the web pages.
### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
    Used for styling and laying out web pages.
### JavaScript: 
    A programming language for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web pages.
### React.js: 
    A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly suited for developing single-page applications.

## 2.Back-End (Server-Side):
### Node.js: 
    A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
### Express.js: 
    A web application framework that runs on top of Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.
### Sequelize: 
    An Object-Relational Mapping(ORM) library for Node.js, which simplifies the interaction with SQL databases.
### PostgreSQL: 
    A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## 3. Developement Tools and Libraries:
### Vite: 
    A modren frontend development and build tool that offers features like fast server start and hot module replacement (HMR).
    
    Hot Module Replacement(HMR) is a feature in modern web development that allows you to see changes in your code immediately in the browser without having to reload the whole page. It's like live editing - when you change your code, those changes appear instantly on your website, making it faster and easier to develop and test your work.
